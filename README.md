## Overview

I coded the UI of a results summary component. According to my estimations, I could have done it in one hour and half, but it took longer than that due to some problems that helped me learned new things.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Linear gradiient CSS property
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use the linear gradient css property, how to structure my css in a better way and how to extract data from a json with JavaScript.

### Continued development

To be more productive, I'd like to incorporate SASS. Since I know that's possible to use some kind of loop and mappings to set the different variants of the card elments. Besides, learning new UI design concepts could help me improve my naming and save me time.
